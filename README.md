Package goob (github.com/Lealen/goob) implements data-driven templates for
generating HTML pages right on a client side. It was based on knockout.js,
but i hated it for some reason (it was terrible for using on a large scale
systems), so i created this equivalent in pure Go. It is using a GopherJS
to compile to javascript. Also it is designed to be very fast
and memory-efficient, so you will not waste your time on a project that will
not allow you to later expand your greatness application, also it is very easy
to use, so... go ahead and try it.

ATTENTION!!! This package is under heavy development, many things can break!
Use it at your own risk!
